# Data Science Project for PUC Rio
This is an MVP-based project for the especialization course on Data Science and Analytics by PUC Rio (Brazil).
The subject of this module's project is Database.
The notebook was built on Databricks Community Edition to facilitate readability and understanding for external users. 
To this end, data processing and manipulation operations, the data pipeline, the creation and updates of the Delta Lake,
the Data Catalog, and other content were built sequentially within this single file.
